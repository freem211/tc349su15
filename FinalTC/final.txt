Final Dontae Freeman The first thing I would like to address is the fact that trying to code live tiles proved to be very difficult. I found code that would make the images flip but the content on the back was not easy to code with my limited skills and time.  Also trying to add a comment section to the picture threw off the pixels. I went with the simple design while adding the menu from the first design.  I turned the boarders off on the CSS because they made the site load slow in my browser, kind like dial up.
